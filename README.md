# Portfolio
A collection of my data analysis projectsâ€”more to come!

## 2025 Car Cost Analysis
This project analyzes the total cost of ownership (TCO) for various car models over five years, comparing gas, hybrid, and electric vehicles (EVs). Using Excel, I compiled and processed data on MSRP, fuel costs, maintenance, depreciation, insurance, and tax credits.

Key features:
- Interactive Excel dashboard with pivot tables and slicers for easy data exploration.
- Automated calculations to estimate total ownership costs based on key factors.

Disclaimer: This is a personal project for data analysis practice. The figures are estimates based on available data and should not be taken as financial advice.

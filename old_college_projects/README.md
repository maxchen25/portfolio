## IS4420 Database Fundamentals – Restaurant Database
Worked with a team to design a fictional restaurant database, applying core database concepts. We built tables, added a trigger, and spent quite a bit of time inserting fictional data. Additionally, we created five queries, two views, and three stored procedures to help manage and retrieve data.

## IS4460 Web-Based Applications – FISH R US Project
Collaborated on a basic website for a fictional fish pet store. We created a database and used PHP (though I’ve since forgotten most of it!) to handle essential website functions such as secure login, adding items to a cart, checkout, and managing products (adding, updating, and removing).

## IS4485 Python – COVID Analysis
Analyzed COVID-19 data from various countries using Python. Utilized pandas for data parsing and cleaning, and matplotlib for visualizing trends in confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries.
